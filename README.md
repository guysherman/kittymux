# kittymux

One of the useful things about tmux is its session/window browser. This is a tool to give 
kitty that same superpower. The idea is to bind a hotkey to run it in a new window in kitty 
so that you can jump to known windows whenever you want.

Still working on things like useful hotkeys, keybinding, etc to make it easy to manage windows without using a mouse etc.

Very much a work in progress, but issues and comments welcome :)
